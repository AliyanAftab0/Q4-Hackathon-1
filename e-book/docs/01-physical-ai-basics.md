# Physical AI Basics

Physical AI refers to AI systems that interact with the physical world. Unlike pure software AI (like ChatGPT), Physical AI agents must perceive, reason, and act within the constraints of physics.

## Key Concepts

1.  **Embodiment**: The body shapes the mind.
2.  **Sensors & Actuators**: The interface with reality.
3.  **Control Loops**: Perception-Action cycles.

> "The body is not just a container for the mind, it is the mechanism by which the mind thinks."
