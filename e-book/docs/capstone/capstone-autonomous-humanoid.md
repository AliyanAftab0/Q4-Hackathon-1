# 23. Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

Use everything you've learned to build the final project.

## The Mission
Your robot must:
1.  **Wake up** in a simulated home (Isaac Sim).
2.  **Patrol** until it finds a spilled cup (Object Detection).
3.  **Plan** a path to it (Nav2).
4.  **Pick it up** (VLA/Grasping).
5.  **Place it** in the sink.

## Architecture
- **Brain**: Jetson Orin (VLA + VSLAM).
- **Body**: Unitree H1 or Custom URDF.
- **Sim**: Isaac Sim 4.0.

Good luck, roboticist.
