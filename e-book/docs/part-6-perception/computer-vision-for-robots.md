# 18. Computer Vision for Robots

## Object Detection (YOLOv8)
"Where is the cup?"
- fast (Real-time).
- Bounding Box output.

## Semantic Segmentation
"Which pixels are the floor?"
- Pixel-wise classification.
- Crucial for identifying safe walking areas.

## 6D Pose Estimation
"How exactly is the mug oriented so I can grasp the handle?"
- $(x, y, z)$ + $(roll, pitch, yaw)$.
- Algorithms: **PoseCNN**, **DOPE** (Deep Object Pose Estimation).
